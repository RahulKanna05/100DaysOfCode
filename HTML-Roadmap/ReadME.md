# ROAD MAP

This is the `ROADMAP` I followed during my HTML travel. Its pinned down to very important elements and in a sequencial order from basic to pro.
I referred [`W3Schools`](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp), [`freeCodeCamp`](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/) and MDN Docs throughtout the journey.

My special thanks to [**`frontend-joe`**](https://github.com/frontend-joe) to coming up with such a great roadmap for HTML.
